BudgetAllocation :- In this module the objective was to distribute Marketing budget in a way that increases the customer engagement i.e we should be able to promote the top customers into a level above and able to retain the customers which can slip to level below .
For that the customers was divided into 5 levels using predefined parameters. Further each level was divided into promotion ,consistence and retention using percentiles . Bands was used in order to increase and decrease the number of customers in promotion, consistence and 
retention. For the distribution of marketing budget let's say we have amount ₹100 then we will first divide the amount among levels according to total share of level in total sales , for example level 5 has total share of 15% in total sales then ₹15 will be allocated to level 5 and it will be further divided into half among promotion and retention groups i.e ₹7.5 and ₹7.5 which will be divided equally among custmores in those groups and we will leave consistent customers as it is.
